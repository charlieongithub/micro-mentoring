# Micro Mentoring App

>What is micro-mentoring? Micro-mentoring is just what it sounds like: It's a short-term mentoring relationship. You can exchange in an informal way without having the disadvantage of long-lasting commitment with your mentor.

## About

Have you ever been stuck working on some **thing**, where 30 minutes talking to an expert on **thing** over coffee would have unstuck you? The _Micro Mentoring Bot_ is here to help!

The _Micro Mentoring Bot_ will help you find experts from across the company or let you tell others about _your_ expertise. You can also give **kudos** to your colleagues for their expertise, to appreciate them for your work.

> Kudos: public admiration a person receives as a result of a particular achievement or position in society e.g. being an actor has kudos attached to it.

## Find a mentor

You can find a mentor with the `/who-knows-about` [slash command](https://slack.com/intl/en-ch/help/articles/201259356-Use-built-in-slash-commands) for example;

- `/who-knows-about slackbots`
- `/who-knows-about google analytics`
- `/who-knows-about OKRs`

**Tip**: type `/who-knows-about` without a search term to see all the mentors

## Say "thanks" with kudos
